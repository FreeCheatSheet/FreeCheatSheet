# **Introduction**

Greetings and welcome to the FCS (FreeCheatSheet) Github! It's crucial to read the introduction carefully to avoid getting fined or hacked. To assist you in navigating this document with ease, we have color-coded all the key points. Please note that important <span style="color:cyan;" information> will be in cyan to ensure it catches your attention</span>. Links will be marked in green, and we may consider color-coding them in the future. You'll find notes in yellow, which contain less critical information, while untested websites will be in orange. Please exercise caution while clicking on them.
